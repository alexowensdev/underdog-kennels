				<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_0  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Thanks to <strong>dog boarding</strong> centers and <strong><a href="https://underdog-kennels.com/dog-daycare/">doggy daycares</a></strong>, pet owners are able to enjoy an escape every now and then – whether it’s a weekend getaway or a 10-day retreat. One of the most exciting aspects about preparing for a vacation is packing your bags. However, it’s also one of the most important, as failure to pack necessary items can leave you unequipped for certain situations. Hence, when packing for an overnight stay, you must be very thorough and organized. The same is true for packing your dog’s bag for his boarding stay.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whether your dog is a new or seasoned boarder, you want to make sure that he has everything he needs to feel comfortable and stress-free while you are away. At most facilities, <strong><a href="https://www.underdog-kennels.com/prices/">dog boarding costs</a></strong> include bedding, treats, and other supplies for your dog during their stay. However, pet owners are welcome, and often encouraged, to bring along a few additional items to help your dog enjoy the boarding experience as much as possible. Here are 7 items to pack in your pet’s doggy bag for his dog boarding stay.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. </strong><strong>FOOD</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Most pet owners stick with 1 to 2 different types of food that they know their dog enjoys. If you have ever tried to introduce a different type of brand or food to your dog, you know that this can cause a negative change in appetite and even upset stomach. Since your dog may already feel uneasy in the unfamiliar environment of the <strong>dog daycare</strong>, you want to keep the other aspects of his life as normal as possible. Provide your pet sitter with enough food to last the entire duration of your dog’s stay. Use small plastic baggies to package pre-measured meals, and label them “Breakfast”, “Lunch”, and “Dinner”. This will ensure that your dog is getting exactly the right amount of food for each meal. If there is any food leftover, the pet sitters will be able to tell that your dog may be feeling stressed or uncomfortable.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. MEDICINE &amp; SUPPLEMENTS</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Many dogs must take certain medication and/or supplements on a daily basis, and your <strong><a href="https://www.underdog-kennels.com/services/boarding/">dog boarding facility</a></strong> will be happy to administer these to them as needed. Include the appropriate number of doses that your dog will need to take in your absence, as well as written instructions with details such as dosage amount and schedule. If the medicine and/or supplements must be taken with food, it’s helpful to include them in the pre-packaged meal bags.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes being in an unfamiliar environment and being around other dogs can trigger an existing ailment in your dog. In addition to any regular medications, include emergency medications that you think may be necessary just in case.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. FAVORITE TOYS</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Dog daycares like <strong><a href="https://www.underdog-kennels.com/about-under-dog-kennels/">Underdog Kennels</a></strong> are well equipped with all sorts of toys for your pet to play with. However, almost every dog has their favorites that they just can’t live without. Pack 1 or 2 of these toys to make sure your dog has all of the fun that he enjoys at home.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong> 4. </strong><strong>A REMINDER OF HOME</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder, and this is especially true for pets and their owners. No matter how much fun you and your pet are having, you on your vacation and your dog with his new friends, you will surely miss each others’ company. To keep your dog feeling close to you even in your absence, include something with your scent. This can be a blanket, t-shirt, or even a sock. This is a wonderful way to help your dog feel comfortable, calm, and stress-free.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. </strong><strong>AT LEAST 1 LEASH</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Most <strong>doggie daycares</strong> require sending your dog with 1 leash, but it’s always a good idea to include 2 in case the other is lost.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY DOGGY DAYCARE</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>If you have not submitted all of the paperwork necessary beforehand, be sure that all required documents and forms are ready to present on drop off day. This could include everything from medical records, vaccination charts, contracts, and rule acknowledgment forms. <strong><a href="https://www.underdog-kennels.com/contact/">Contact</a></strong> the pet daycare if you have any questions about a specific form or document.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>As your dog’s owner, you know more about him than anyone else on the planet. Does your dog have a special food or water bowl that he loves to eat and drink out of? Does he have a KONG or certain treats that make his tail wag? Think of items that will help your dog feel happy and comfortable and throw them into your dog’s overnight bag.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">PET OWNERS AND DALLAS PET BOARDING: PARTNERS IN YOUR DOG’S COMFORT</h2>
<p></p>
<p>As a dog boarding center, our goal is to make your dog feel as happy and calm as possible throughout the duration of his stay. By thoroughly packing your dog’s bag, you better equip us to do so.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_row et_pb_row_1">
								<div class="et_pb_column et_pb_column_4_4 et_pb_column_1  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child">

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Studies show Dog Daycare reduces anxiety, eases loneliness, and stops destructive behavior. Here’s how and other great benefits you and your pup receive from it:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>REDUCED ANXIETY</strong></h2>



<p>When our dogs are at home or around their owners, they have a “self-perceived” job to do…they must guard you, your family and your home. I say it’s “self-perceived” because in all actuality, in most cases, you’re the one providing the security, but our dogs (even our 10 lbs. Chihuahuas) believe it’s their job. This job creates a lot of anxiety for our dogs. It’s a 24/7/365 responsibility. When your dog gets to play at dog daycare – they leave all that responsibility behind and they get to play like kids (or dogs). Plus, your dog will make doggy friends at dog daycare. Just like people, our dogs tend to gravitate toward other beings based on their own personal preferences and make furry BFFs. Most guests come on a very routine basis (i.e.: every Monday, Tuesdays &amp; Thursday even every day Monday thru Friday). Because of this regularity, dogs create very strong friendships with the other dogs. Dogs also consider the employees they see at dog daycare on a regular basis to be members of “their pack”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>RELIEVES BOREDOM AND LONELINESS</strong></h2>



<p>Mental stimulation is extremely important for your dog. When dogs are bored at home, this boredom can lead to destructive behavior. Bored dogs tend to find ways to entertain themselves which can include chewing furniture, eating unintended items or worse. When your dog attends dog daycare – they are actively engaged in many interesting activities which provides mental stimulation for them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>EXERCISE</strong></h2>



<p>Getting the proper amount of exercise is not only important for humans but it’s also extremely important for our dogs. Health benefits of attending dog daycare on a regular basis range widely, but include keeping your dog at a healthy weight, helping hip joints and other parts of the body stay limber as well as decreasing the likelihood of developing other health problems. Regular exercise at dog daycare can also help reduce behavioral problems. Dogs that don’t receive enough of an outlet for their energy may develop destructive habits like chewing or scratching on furniture or doors, counter-surfing, excessive licking and/or excessing barking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SOCIALIZATION</strong></h2>



<p>Dogs are descended from wolves which means they are pack animals which were designed to interact with others. Proper socialization requires exposure to other humans outside of your family and to other dogs. The best time to start this socialization is when your dog is still a puppy – ideally when they are 4 months old. By this age, their immune system has matured enough for them to safely interact with other dogs in a healthy way. This also coincides with the age that most doggy daycares will allow puppies to first start attending. This exposure to other humans and other dogs, showing them that others are not a threat will help boost your dog’s confidence, making them less likely to bark, jump or bite. With proper socialization, you and your dog will be able to enjoy leisurely walks in the park and relaxing refreshments on restaurant patios. Dog daycare also gives your dog the opportunity to talk “dog” with other beings and make furry BFFs that they’ll look forward to seeing the next time they attend dog daycare.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SAFETY</strong></h2>



<p>Playful pups require watchful supervision to make sure everyone is playing “by the rules”, no one is being physically dominated and there are no body-crashing bulldogs slamming into fragile teacup poodles. There are no guarantees of this if you take your dog to a dog park. Unfortunately, at dog park, most parents are scrolling through Facebook or if they are watching their dog – they don’t know what’s acceptable dog behavior or aren’t schooled in being able to read dog body language to know that a dog fight is about to break out. At dog daycares with good reputations, the safety of your furry family member is their primary concern. The best dog daycares will have a minimum of at least 2 attendants with each playgroup to ensure safety and will have a guest to attendant ration of at most 1 to 15 and keep adding attendants if the group becomes larger in size. These attendants are trained in dog behavior and dog body language and can generally react to those cues before anything injurious can happen to your dog. They have a vested interest in everyone going home healthy so they continue to come back for more dog daycare.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>LOTS OF AFFECTION AND TLC</strong></h2>



<p>People who own and/or work at dog daycare facilities do it because they LOVE dogs. It’s a hard job. Up early, long days. Mopping pee and picking up poop. Why? Because they LOVE dogs. The tradeoff for all this hard work is being around the sweetest creatures on the planet – dogs! Dogs love unconditionally and the people working at dog daycare facilities return this affection in spades. Your dog will receive hugs and kisses and tummy rubs and cuddles all day long.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PEACE OF MIND FOR THE DOG PARENT</strong></h2>



<p>Dog daycares are brick and mortar businesses. A professional business owner has invested a considerable amount of time, money, and effort to open and operate their facility. They have a reputation which can be greatly impacted by poor service so most do their best job possible to keep customers happy and attract new ones. Internet-based Dog Walking Services are only as good as the individual who shows up at your home each time. Many dog walkers were baristas last month and will be folding sweaters at the GAP next month. Nothing against those companies (we love coffee and casual clothes) but an independent dog walker generally does not provide the same peace of mind as someone who has a lot of “skin in the game” so to speak.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PROVIDES ROUTINE</strong></h2>



<p>Dogs are creatures of habit. They love routine. Uncertainty creates stress for your dog. Providing a consistent routine for your dog helps keep them calm. Having a consistent time for walk times, feeding times, exercise times and nap times all create routine for our dogs. Taking your dog to a well-established dog daycare helps reinforce these routines. Your dog will play at the same times, be fed at the same times, nap at the same times.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AFFORDABILITY</strong></h2>



<p>When compared to the cost of using a dog walking service, dog daycare is VERY affordable. Most dog daycare services include multiple play sessions spanning a full 8 to 5 day (most are open 7 to 7) and feeding breakfast, lunch and dinner at no additional cost. To hire a dog walker to come into your home and provide comparable services and time spent keeping your furry family member company, a recent survey shows it would cost well over $80 per day. Plus, most dog daycare providers also offer Frequent Player Discounts, which can make dog daycare even more affordable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ONE-STOP SHOPPING</strong></h2>



<p>Most dog daycares do not just provide dog daycare, they also provide many other goods and services which you routinely may need for your furry family member. Most daycares also offer overnight dog boarding and dog grooming. Many others provide retail items for sale ranging from dog food, collars, and leashes up to dog clothing or even kitschy bar wear or home goods. Some Dogg Daycares which are partnered with vet hospitals even provide vaccinations.</p>



<p><strong>About Underdog Kennels:</strong></p>



<p>At Underdog Kennels, we Temperament Test all guests during a Meet &amp; Greet Day who wish to play in Dog Daycare to ensure they are DOG FRIENDLY and then our guests are divided up into different play groups based on a combination of their: size, age, play style, and temperament to ensure they will be in a playgroup where they’ll have fun but more importantly, will be very safe for them.<br>Underdog Kennels Dog Daycare is structured based on the latest Dog Behavioral Research which shows our dogs are much like small children toddler age or slightly older. Most dogs who are left in an open playgroup with other dogs all day long will become over-stimulated. This over-stimulation contributes to aggression, stress, and exhaustion (think about a toddler who never takes a nap).</p>



<p>For this reason, Underdog Kennels Dog Daycare schedules it’s day so each playgroup goes out and plays together in the morning and also again in the afternoon but has restful naptimes in the comfort and privacy of their own rooms in between their play sessions. This also compliments their natural circadian rhythms (body clocks) as dogs are intended to take multiple restful naps throughout the day.</p>



<p>Our goal is not to exhaust your dog but to send them home calm, content, and relaxed so you can still enjoy their company at the end of your busy workday.</p></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Most people wonder, “what&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;happens at dog daycare”? &nbsp;As an owner of a dog daycare, Underdog Kennels in Dallas, TX I’m going to reveal it all to you: &nbsp;the good, the bad, and the ugly.</p>



<p>If you’ve never taken your furry family member to dog daycare, they are missing out.&nbsp; Most dogs LOVE IT!&nbsp; Not everyone, but in my experience, most dogs absolutely love going to dog daycare.</p>



<p>For some dogs, the excitement starts before they even get to dog daycare.&nbsp; Some of our customers tell us their dogs get so excited about going to dog daycare they are too excited to eat their breakfast, so many of them bring their breakfasts along with them and we feed it to them.</p>



<p>Many of our customers tell us their dogs get super excited as they drive to Underdog Kennels and will begin to get very boisterous and jump around in their cars as they get closer and closer to being dropped off at dog daycare.</p>



<p>Once they arrive at dog daycare, they generally fly through our front door and make a beeline straight for the doorway which leads to our overnight boarding and dog daycare play areas, generally never looking back once to tell Mom or Dad, “goodbye”.&nbsp; I used to experience this before I owned a dog daycare and was just a consumer of the services for my own family.&nbsp; At first, this always hurt my feelings a little bit, but I came to realize this was a good thing – they LOVED going to dog daycare.&nbsp; This realization brought me great comfort knowing they were in good hands when I couldn’t watch over them and brought me a great deal of peace of mind.</p>



<p>Once past the doors of the dog daycare what&nbsp;<strong><em>really</em></strong>&nbsp;happens?</p>



<p><strong>Socializing</strong>&nbsp;– speaking “dog” with their furry friends and becoming more comfortable around others.&nbsp; Dogs are descended from wolves which means they are pack animals.&nbsp; They were designed to interact with others.&nbsp; Proper socialization requires exposure to other humans outside of your family and to other dogs.&nbsp; The best time to start this socialization is when your dog is still a puppy – ideally when they are 4 months old.&nbsp; By this age, their immune system has matured enough for them to safely interact with other dogs in a healthy way.&nbsp; This is the age that most doggy daycares will allow puppies to first start attending.&nbsp; With proper socialization, you and your dog will be able to enjoy leisurely walks in the park and relaxing refreshments on restaurant patios.&nbsp; Proper socialization also boosts your dog’s confidence, which creates a calmer dog.&nbsp; The dogs will make “best friends” which they tend to hang out with and play with.&nbsp; They will literally smile when their BFF walks in.&nbsp; It’s the cutest thing to see.</p>



<p><strong>Playing</strong>&nbsp;– of course, lots of playing takes place at dog daycare.&nbsp; Watching dogs play together never gets old.&nbsp; Dogs play in 4 Distinct Playstyles:&nbsp; Chasing, Neck Biting, Body Slamming, and Cat-like play.&nbsp; Most dogs utilize a combination of these play styles.&nbsp; At a good dog daycare provider, there will be plenty of trained supervision to make sure everyone is “playing by the rules” and no inappropriate behavior or unsafe play takes place.&nbsp; Playing at dog daycare is much safer than going to the dog park.</p>



<p><strong>Different Personalities at Dog Daycare</strong>&nbsp;– while every dog is wonderful and unique in their own way, we see certain personalities emerge at dog daycare…the Alpha, the class clown, everybody’s best friend, the fun police, happy-go-lucky, I’m cautious – so let’s go slowly, independent, playful, resource guarder, rough &amp; tumble, the social butterfly, submissive, talkative and well behaved.&nbsp; It’s great fun to watch them all interact with each other.</p>



<p><strong>Running</strong>&nbsp;– depending on the dog, there can be lots of running at dog daycare.&nbsp; Some dogs love&nbsp;<em>to be chased</em>&nbsp;and some dogs love&nbsp;<em>to</em>&nbsp;<em>chase</em>&nbsp;so it makes for a perfect game for them to play.</p>



<p><strong>Jumping</strong>&nbsp;– this is a favorite pastime for many dogs.&nbsp; Dogs are very athletic and love showing off their jumping skills in front of their buddies.&nbsp; Many dog daycare facilities will play with bubbles (some are even bacon-flavored – non-toxic of course) blowing them for the dogs to chase.&nbsp; Many of the pups will jump into the air and bight them.</p>



<p><strong>Climbing</strong>&nbsp;– many dogs are very adventurous and love to climb on things, so many dog daycares will have play equipment that the pups can climb on, under or through.&nbsp; Some even have slides which the dogs actually slide down.&nbsp; Dogs really are just furry kids when given the chance!</p>



<p><strong>Tummy Rubs, Ear Scratches, and Snuggles</strong>– This happens a lot at dog daycare.&nbsp; The staff at these facilities are DOG LOVERS!&nbsp; Your pup will get loved on all day long when you take them to dog daycare.&nbsp; The staff will become part of your pup’s pack.</p>



<p><strong>Sniffing</strong>&nbsp;– dogs experience the world through their mouths and their noses.&nbsp; The average dog has a sense of smell that is about 100,000 times more sensitive than a human’s partly because dog noses contain 150 million olfactory receptors while human noses only have 5 million.&nbsp; When we smell a pizza – we smell pizza, your dog smells&nbsp;<em>every ingredient</em>&nbsp;in the pizza.&nbsp; &nbsp;And dogs devote about 1/3 of their brain mass to the detection and identification of odors, while humans utilize a mere 5% for olfactory purposes.</p>



<p>Everything gets sniffed at dog daycare, including other dog’s butts.&nbsp; Why do they do this?!&nbsp; According to VCA Animal Hospitals:&nbsp;<a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/why-dogs-sniff-butts">https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/why-dogs-sniff-butts</a></p>



<p>Inside the rectum are two small sacs called anal glands which secrete a noxious smelling substance into the rectum through a pair of tiny openings.</p>



<p>Dogs sniff butts as a form of greeting and obtain vital information from the anal secretions. Is this dog friend or foe? Is he going to be a good “date”? Will he be aggressive? Is he feeling ill? And because the odor is unique to every dog, two dogs can quickly determine if they’ve met before. That aroma emanating from the anal region is a unique form of canine identification.</p>



<p>The manner in which dogs sniff rear ends can establish which of two dogs is dominant and set the foundation of a canine relationship. The dominant dog will initiate the sniffing while the submissive dog waits his turn. A submissive dog may stop sniffing first and retreat. A dominant dog may growl to end the smelling session. Some dogs like to limit the information they give out and will simply sit down and clamp their tails over their rectums reducing the odor they emit.</p>



<p>Dogs also have a good scent memory that can identify other dogs they haven’t seen for years and who was the dominant member of the pair simply by smell. When dogs belonging to the same family are separated for a while, they use the sense of smell to catch up on things. Changes in odors may convey where the dog went, what he ate, and what he did.</p>



<p>In addition to chemical communication, there is another purpose to butt-sniffing. Dogs smell rear ends as a calming mechanism. Performing this innate ritual soothes them and serves as a stress reliever. Plus, sniffing is much quicker than a lengthy conversation. So, even though sniffing butts seem revolting to us, try to think of it as a healthy, socially acceptable form of canine communication!</p>



<p><strong>Sunbathing</strong>&nbsp;– who doesn’t like to soak up some rays?!&nbsp; Vitamin D makes us all feel good and the warm penetrating rays of the sun can be really relaxing.</p>



<p><strong>Napping</strong>&nbsp;– this should be a very important part of dog daycare.&nbsp; Dogs are designed to take many restful naps throughout the day.&nbsp; It’s in keeping with their natural circadian rhythms (body clocks). &nbsp;Most dogs who are left in an open playgroup with other dogs all day long will become over-stimulated. This over-stimulation contributes to aggression, stress, and exhaustion (think about a toddler who never takes a nap).&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, the guests at Underdog Kennels get some restful naptimes in the comfort and privacy of their own rooms throughout the day.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sleep.org/articles/how-much-do-dogs-sleep/">According to experts at the&nbsp;National Sleep Foundation</a>, it’s normal for dogs to spend about 50% of their day asleep. Another 30% of the day is spent “resting,” while dogs are active, just about 20% of the day.</p>



<p>Canine sleeping patterns closely mimic our own, but differ in a key way. Entering sleep, they take about 10 minutes to transition from the slow wave — during which breathing slows, blood pressure drops, and heart rate decreases — into rapid eye movement (REM). In the REM phase, their eyes roll under closed lids, and their body might react to dreams.&nbsp; This is what’s taking place when your dog is moving their legs or making cute noises while asleep.</p>



<p>Dogs only spend about 10 percent of their snoozing time in REM because of their irregular sleep patterns. Since they tend to doze off whenever they want, often out of boredom, they also wake up quickly and jump to alertness. By contrast, humans spend up to 25 percent of sleep in REM, reflecting their more typical schedule of staying awake all day and resting through the night.&nbsp; As a result, dogs require more total sleep to compensate for their lost REM.</p>



<p><strong>Relaxing</strong>&nbsp;– this is one of the best benefits of dog daycare…your dog gets to relax and just be a kid!&nbsp; When our dogs are with their owners, they feel they have a job to do:&nbsp; protect you, protect your family and protect your home and yard.&nbsp; This comes instinctually to them.&nbsp; This job can be stressful.&nbsp; When they come to dog daycare, they leave all those responsibilities behind and they just get to goof off, play with their furry friends and relax.</p>



<p><strong>Pooping</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&amp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Peeing –&nbsp;</strong>I said I was going to reveal it&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;to you…now for the less appealing side of dog daycare.&nbsp; Pooping – everyone poops.&nbsp; It’s a part of life.&nbsp; No big deal.</p>



<p>Peeing is a bigger deal at dog daycare.&nbsp; It’s been said: “Dogs read about the world through their noses, and they write their messages, at least to other dogs, in their urine.”</p>



<p>Dogs use their urine to mark areas they consider to be theirs. Marking their territory lets other dogs know that they are present. Urine also signifies the reproductive status of the dog and their ranking. Dogs who aren’t altered (<a href="https://www.caninejournal.com/benefits-of-spaying-and-neutering/">spayed or neutered</a>) are more likely to mark than those who are fixed</p>



<p>Exciting social situations can trigger urine marking. &nbsp;Some male dogs only urine mark when in the presence of female dogs (especially if they’re in heat), and some urine mark only when interacting with other male dogs. Some dogs only urine mark when visiting homes where other dogs have urine marked before. Other dogs only urine mark when they become highly aroused and overstimulated in social situations. These dogs often mark nearby objects, people or other dogs.</p>



<p>Occasionally, someone can get peed on completely by accident because one dog is busy sniffing while another dog decides it’s time to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; If we see this occur, we’ll give that dog a courtesy bath.</p>



<p>Dogs may even mark on their own beds while at dog daycare or overnight boarding to let the other dogs know it’s their property.&nbsp; Hopefully, we notice this, and we’ll throw it in the wash before it goes home.</p>



<p><strong>Fun</strong>&nbsp;– lastly, the most common thing that happens at dog daycare is the dogs have fun!&nbsp; Whether they are running, jumping, sniffing, or wrestling, the dogs are having a great time, and smiles are everywhere and our guests go home calm, content, and relaxed.&nbsp; There is never a bad day at dog daycare and I feel blessed to have the best job<strong><em>&nbsp;EVER</em></strong>.</p>



<p><strong>About Underdog Kennels:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>At Underdog Kennels, we Temperament Test all guests who wish to play in Dog Daycare to ensure they are&nbsp;<strong><em>DOG FRIENDLY</em></strong>&nbsp;and then our guests are divided up into different playgroups based on a combination of their:&nbsp; size, age, play style, and temperament to ensure they will be in a playgroup where they’ll have fun but more importantly, will be very safe for them.</p>



<p>Underdog Kennels Dog Daycare is structured based on the latest Dog Behavioral Research which shows our dogs are much like small children toddler age or slightly older.&nbsp; Most dogs who are left in an open playgroup with other dogs all day long will become over-stimulated. This over-stimulation contributes to aggression, stress, and exhaustion (think about a toddler who never takes a nap).</p>



<p>For this reason, Underdog Kennels Dog Daycare is structured so each playgroup goes out and plays together in the morning and also in the afternoon but has restful naptimes in the comfort and privacy of their own rooms in between their play sessions. This also compliments their natural circadian rhythms (body clocks) as dogs are intended to take multiple restful naps throughout the day.</p>



<p>Our goal is not to exhaust your dog but to send them home calm, content, and relaxed so you can still enjoy their company at the end of your busy workday.</p>



<p>Each guest has their own private room for naptimes and to be fed or play with their own toys in privacy is a unique amenity at Underdog Kennels.</p>
