Most dogs LOVE IT!&nbsp; Not everyone, but in my experience, most dogs absolutely love going to dog daycare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some dogs, the excitement starts before they even get to dog daycare.&nbsp; Some of our customers tell us their dogs get so excited about going to dog daycare they are too excited to eat their breakfast, so many of them bring their breakfasts along with them and we feed it to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our customers tell us their dogs get super excited as they drive to Underdog Kennels and will begin to get very boisterous and jump around in their cars as they get closer and closer to being dropped off at dog daycare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once they arrive at dog daycare, they generally fly through our front door and make a beeline straight for the doorway which leads to our overnight boarding and dog daycare play areas, generally never looking back once to tell Mom or Dad, \u201cgoodbye\u201d.&nbsp; I used to experience this before I owned a dog daycare and was just a consumer of the services for my own family.&nbsp; At first, this always hurt my feelings a little bit, but I came to realize this was a good thing \u2013 they LOVED going to dog daycare.&nbsp; This realization brought me great comfort knowing they were in good hands when I couldn\u2019t watch over them and brought me a great deal of peace of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once past the doors of the dog daycare what&nbsp;<strong><em>really<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;happens?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Socializing<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 speaking \u201cdog\u201d with their furry friends and becoming more comfortable around others.&nbsp; Dogs are descended from wolves which means they are pack animals.&nbsp; They were designed to interact with others.&nbsp; Proper socialization requires exposure to other humans outside of your family and to other dogs.&nbsp; The best time to start this socialization is when your dog is still a puppy \u2013 ideally when they are 4 months old.&nbsp; By this age, their immune system has matured enough for them to safely interact with other dogs in a healthy way.&nbsp; This is the age that most doggy daycares will allow puppies to first start attending.&nbsp; With proper socialization, you and your dog will be able to enjoy leisurely walks in the park and relaxing refreshments on restaurant patios.&nbsp; Proper socialization also boosts your dog\u2019s confidence, which creates a calmer dog.&nbsp; The dogs will make \u201cbest friends\u201d which they tend to hang out with and play with.&nbsp; They will literally smile when their BFF walks in.&nbsp; It\u2019s the cutest thing to see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Playing<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 of course, lots of playing takes place at dog daycare.&nbsp; Watching dogs play together never gets old.&nbsp; Dogs play in 4 Distinct Playstyles:&nbsp; Chasing, Neck Biting, Body Slamming, and Cat-like play.&nbsp; Most dogs utilize a combination of these play styles.&nbsp; At a good dog daycare provider, there will be plenty of trained supervision to make sure everyone is \u201cplaying by the rules\u201d and no inappropriate behavior or unsafe play takes place.&nbsp; Playing at dog daycare is much safer than going to the dog park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Different Personalities at Dog Daycare<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 while every dog is wonderful and unique in their own way, we see certain personalities emerge at dog daycare\u2026the Alpha, the class clown, everybody\u2019s best friend, the fun police, happy-go-lucky, I\u2019m cautious \u2013 so let\u2019s go slowly, independent, playful, resource guarder, rough &amp; tumble, the social butterfly, submissive, talkative and well behaved.&nbsp; It\u2019s great fun to watch them all interact with each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Running<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 depending on the dog, there can be lots of running at dog daycare.&nbsp; Some dogs love&nbsp;<em>to be chased<\/em>&nbsp;and some dogs love&nbsp;<em>to<\/em>&nbsp;<em>chase<\/em>&nbsp;so it makes for a perfect game for them to play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jumping<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 this is a favorite pastime for many dogs.&nbsp; Dogs are very athletic and love showing off their jumping skills in front of their buddies.&nbsp; Many dog daycare facilities will play with bubbles (some are even bacon-flavored \u2013 non-toxic of course) blowing them for the dogs to chase.&nbsp; Many of the pups will jump into the air and bight them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Climbing<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 many dogs are very adventurous and love to climb on things, so many dog daycares will have play equipment that the pups can climb on, under or through.&nbsp; Some even have slides which the dogs actually slide down.&nbsp; Dogs really are just furry kids when given the chance!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tummy Rubs, Ear Scratches, and Snuggles<\/strong>\u2013 This happens a lot at dog daycare.&nbsp; The staff at these facilities are DOG LOVERS!&nbsp; Your pup will get loved on all day long when you take them to dog daycare.&nbsp; The staff will become part of your pup\u2019s pack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sniffing<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 dogs experience the world through their mouths and their noses.&nbsp; The average dog has a sense of smell that is about 100,000 times more sensitive than a human\u2019s partly because dog noses contain 150 million olfactory receptors while human noses only have 5 million.&nbsp; When we smell a pizza \u2013 we smell pizza, your dog smells&nbsp;<em>every ingredient<\/em>&nbsp;in the pizza.&nbsp; &nbsp;And dogs devote about 1\/3 of their brain mass to the detection and identification of odors, while humans utilize a mere 5% for olfactory purposes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything gets sniffed at dog daycare, including other dog\u2019s butts.&nbsp; Why do they do this?!&nbsp; According to VCA Animal Hospitals:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/vcahospitals.com\/know-your-pet\/why-dogs-sniff-butts\">https:\/\/vcahospitals.com\/know-your-pet\/why-dogs-sniff-butts<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the rectum are two small sacs called anal glands which secrete a noxious smelling substance into the rectum through a pair of tiny openings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogs sniff butts as a form of greeting and obtain vital information from the anal secretions. Is this dog friend or foe? Is he going to be a good \u201cdate\u201d? Will he be aggressive? Is he feeling ill? And because the odor is unique to every dog, two dogs can quickly determine if they\u2019ve met before. That aroma emanating from the anal region is a unique form of canine identification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manner in which dogs sniff rear ends can establish which of two dogs is dominant and set the foundation of a canine relationship. The dominant dog will initiate the sniffing while the submissive dog waits his turn. A submissive dog may stop sniffing first and retreat. A dominant dog may growl to end the smelling session. Some dogs like to limit the information they give out and will simply sit down and clamp their tails over their rectums reducing the odor they emit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogs also have a good scent memory that can identify other dogs they haven\u2019t seen for years and who was the dominant member of the pair simply by smell. When dogs belonging to the same family are separated for a while, they use the sense of smell to catch up on things. Changes in odors may convey where the dog went, what he ate, and what he did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to chemical communication, there is another purpose to butt-sniffing. Dogs smell rear ends as a calming mechanism. Performing this innate ritual soothes them and serves as a stress reliever. Plus, sniffing is much quicker than a lengthy conversation. So, even though sniffing butts seem revolting to us, try to think of it as a healthy, socially acceptable form of canine communication!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sunbathing<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 who doesn\u2019t like to soak up some rays?!&nbsp; Vitamin D makes us all feel good and the warm penetrating rays of the sun can be really relaxing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Napping<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 this should be a very important part of dog daycare.&nbsp; Dogs are designed to take many restful naps throughout the day.&nbsp; It\u2019s in keeping with their natural circadian rhythms (body clocks). &nbsp;Most dogs who are left in an open playgroup with other dogs all day long will become over-stimulated. This over-stimulation contributes to aggression, stress, and exhaustion (think about a toddler who never takes a nap).&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, the guests at Underdog Kennels get some restful naptimes in the comfort and privacy of their own rooms throughout the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sleep.org\/articles\/how-much-do-dogs-sleep\/\">According to experts at the&nbsp;National Sleep Foundation<\/a>, it\u2019s normal for dogs to spend about 50% of their day asleep. Another 30% of the day is spent \u201cresting,\u201d while dogs are active, just about 20% of the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canine sleeping patterns closely mimic our own, but differ in a key way. Entering sleep, they take about 10 minutes to transition from the slow wave \u2014 during which breathing slows, blood pressure drops, and heart rate decreases \u2014 into rapid eye movement (REM). In the REM phase, their eyes roll under closed lids, and their body might react to dreams.&nbsp; This is what\u2019s taking place when your dog is moving their legs or making cute noises while asleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogs only spend about 10 percent of their snoozing time in REM because of their irregular sleep patterns. Since they tend to doze off whenever they want, often out of boredom, they also wake up quickly and jump to alertness. By contrast, humans spend up to 25 percent of sleep in REM, reflecting their more typical schedule of staying awake all day and resting through the night.&nbsp; As a result, dogs require more total sleep to compensate for their lost REM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Relaxing<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 this is one of the best benefits of dog daycare\u2026your dog gets to relax and just be a kid!&nbsp; When our dogs are with their owners, they feel they have a job to do:&nbsp; protect you, protect your family and protect your home and yard.&nbsp; This comes instinctually to them.&nbsp; This job can be stressful.&nbsp; When they come to dog daycare, they leave all those responsibilities behind and they just get to goof off, play with their furry friends and relax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pooping<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>&amp;<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>Peeing \u2013&nbsp;<\/strong>I said I was going to reveal it&nbsp;<em>all<\/em>&nbsp;to you\u2026now for the less appealing side of dog daycare.&nbsp; Pooping \u2013 everyone poops.&nbsp; It\u2019s a part of life.&nbsp; No big deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peeing is a bigger deal at dog daycare.&nbsp; It\u2019s been said: \u201cDogs read about the world through their noses, and they write their messages, at least to other dogs, in their urine.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogs use their urine to mark areas they consider to be theirs. Marking their territory lets other dogs know that they are present. Urine also signifies the reproductive status of the dog and their ranking. Dogs who aren\u2019t altered (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.caninejournal.com\/benefits-of-spaying-and-neutering\/\">spayed or neutered<\/a>) are more likely to mark than those who are fixed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exciting social situations can trigger urine marking. &nbsp;Some male dogs only urine mark when in the presence of female dogs (especially if they\u2019re in heat), and some urine mark only when interacting with other male dogs. Some dogs only urine mark when visiting homes where other dogs have urine marked before. Other dogs only urine mark when they become highly aroused and overstimulated in social situations. These dogs often mark nearby objects, people or other dogs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Occasionally, someone can get peed on completely by accident because one dog is busy sniffing while another dog decides it\u2019s time to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; If we see this occur, we\u2019ll give that dog a courtesy bath.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogs may even mark on their own beds while at dog daycare or overnight boarding to let the other dogs know it\u2019s their property.&nbsp; Hopefully, we notice this, and we\u2019ll throw it in the wash before it goes home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fun<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 lastly, the most common thing that happens at dog daycare is the dogs have fun!&nbsp; Whether they are running, jumping, sniffing, or wrestling, the dogs are having a great time, and smiles are everywhere and our guests go home calm, content, and relaxed.&nbsp; There is never a bad day at dog daycare and I feel blessed to have the best job<strong><em>&nbsp;EVER<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Underdog Kennels:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>At Underdog Kennels, we Temperament Test all guests who wish to play in Dog Daycare to ensure they are&nbsp;<strong><em>DOG FRIENDLY<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;and then our guests are divided up into different playgroups based on a combination of their:&nbsp; size, age, play style, and temperament to ensure they will be in a playgroup where they\u2019ll have fun but more importantly, will be very safe for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Underdog Kennels Dog Daycare is structured based on the latest Dog Behavioral Research which shows our dogs are much like small children toddler age or slightly older.&nbsp; Most dogs who are left in an open playgroup with other dogs all day long will become over-stimulated. This over-stimulation contributes to aggression, stress, and exhaustion (think about a toddler who never takes a nap).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, Underdog Kennels Dog Daycare is structured so each playgroup goes out and plays together in the morning and also in the afternoon but has restful naptimes in the comfort and privacy of their own rooms in between their play sessions. This also compliments their natural circadian rhythms (body clocks) as dogs are intended to take multiple restful naps throughout the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is not to exhaust your dog but to send them home calm, content, and relaxed so you can still enjoy their company at the end of your busy workday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each guest has their own private room for naptimes and to be fed or play with their own toys in privacy is a unique amenity at Underdog Kennels.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most people wonder, \u201cwhat&nbsp;really&nbsp;happens at dog daycare\u201d? &nbsp;As an owner of a dog daycare, Underdog Kennels in Dallas, TX I\u2019m going to reveal it all to you: &nbsp;the good, the bad, and the ugly.

These dogs often mark nearby objects, people or other dogs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Occasionally, someone can get peed on completely by accident because one dog is busy sniffing while another dog decides it\u2019s time to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; If we see this occur, we\u2019ll give that dog a courtesy bath.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dogs may even mark on their own beds while at dog daycare or overnight boarding to let the other dogs know it\u2019s their property.&nbsp; Hopefully, we notice this, and we\u2019ll throw it in the wash before it goes home.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Fun<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 lastly, the most common thing that happens at dog daycare is the dogs have fun!&nbsp; Whether they are running, jumping, sniffing, or wrestling, the dogs are having a great time, and smiles are everywhere and our guests go home calm, content, and relaxed.&nbsp; There is never a bad day at dog daycare and I feel blessed to have the best job<strong><em>&nbsp;EVER<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>About Underdog Kennels:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>At Underdog Kennels, we Temperament Test all guests who wish to play in Dog Daycare to ensure they are&nbsp;<strong><em>DOG FRIENDLY<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;and then our guests are divided up into different playgroups based on a combination of their:&nbsp; size, age, play style, and temperament to ensure they will be in a playgroup where they\u2019ll have fun but more importantly, will be very safe for them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Underdog Kennels Dog Daycare is structured based on the latest Dog Behavioral Research which shows our dogs are much like small children toddler age or slightly older.&nbsp; Most dogs who are left in an open playgroup with other dogs all day long will become over-stimulated. This over-stimulation contributes to aggression, stress, and exhaustion (think about a toddler who never takes a nap).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For this reason, Underdog Kennels Dog Daycare is structured so each playgroup goes out and plays together in the morning and also in the afternoon but has restful naptimes in the comfort and privacy of their own rooms in between their play sessions. This also compliments their natural circadian rhythms (body clocks) as dogs are intended to take multiple restful naps throughout the day.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our goal is not to exhaust your dog but to send them home calm, content, and relaxed so you can still enjoy their company at the end of your busy workday.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each guest has their own private room for naptimes and to be fed or play with their own toys in privacy is a unique amenity at Underdog Kennels.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v22.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>WHAT REALLY HAPPENS AT DOG DAYCARE? - Underdog Kennels<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/underdog-kennels.com\/what-really-happens-at-dog-daycare\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"WHAT REALLY HAPPENS AT DOG DAYCARE? - Underdog Kennels\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Most people wonder, \u201cwhat&nbsp;really&nbsp;happens at dog daycare\u201d? &nbsp;As an owner of a dog daycare, Underdog Kennels in Dallas, TX I\u2019m going to reveal it all to you: &nbsp;the good, the bad, and the ugly.
