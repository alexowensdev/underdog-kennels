One of the most exciting aspects about preparing for a vacation is packing your bags. However, it\u2019s also one of the most important, as failure to pack necessary items can leave you unequipped for certain situations. Hence, when packing for an overnight stay, you must be very thorough and organized. The same is true for packing your dog\u2019s bag for his boarding stay.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Whether your dog is a new or seasoned boarder, you want to make sure that he has everything he needs to feel comfortable and stress-free while you are away. At most facilities,\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underdog-kennels.com\/prices\/\">dog boarding costs<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0include bedding, treats, and other supplies for your dog during their stay. However, pet owners are welcome, and often encouraged, to bring along a few additional items to help your dog enjoy the boarding experience as much as possible. Here are 7 items to pack in your pet\u2019s doggy bag for his dog boarding stay.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>FOOD<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Most pet owners stick with 1 to 2 different types of food that they know their dog enjoys. If you have ever tried to introduce a different type of brand or food to your dog, you know that this can cause a negative change in appetite and even upset stomach. Since your dog may already feel uneasy in the unfamiliar environment of the\u00a0<strong>dog daycare<\/strong>, you want to keep the other aspects of his life as normal as possible. Provide your pet sitter with enough food to last the entire duration of your dog\u2019s stay. Use small plastic baggies to package pre-measured meals, and label them \u201cBreakfast\u201d, \u201cLunch\u201d, and \u201cDinner\u201d. This will ensure that your dog is getting exactly the right amount of food for each meal. If there is any food leftover, the pet sitters will be able to tell that your dog may be feeling stressed or uncomfortable.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. MEDICINE &amp; SUPPLEMENTS<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Many dogs must take certain medication and\/or supplements on a daily basis, and your\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.underdog-kennels.com\/services\/boarding\/\">dog boarding facility<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0will be happy to administer these to them as needed. Include the appropriate number of doses that your dog will need to take in your absence, as well as written instructions with details such as dosage amount and schedule. If the medicine and\/or supplements must be taken with food, it\u2019s helpful to include them in the pre-packaged meal bags.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes being in an unfamiliar environment and being around other dogs can trigger an existing ailment in your dog. In addition to any regular medications, include emergency medications that you think may be necessary just in case.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.
